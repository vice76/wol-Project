              <p>Our Backstory..</p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-contents">
              Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Aroma Mocha opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
              Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Aroma Mocha offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

            <p class="text-contents">
              If you asked us where the coffee beans that went into your cappuccino came from, we'd probably be able to tell you. The journey that the coffee in that perfect cup of yours has been on is worth writing about. The folks that work at our estates are a tenacious bunch. They will visit each coffee plant several times over the harvest season so that they pick the berry when it is just right: neither under-ripe nor over-ripe. The processed beans get carefully roasted, until we hear the second 'pop', which means they're ready.And then comes the grind. We are sure you know that the best coffee comes from freshly ground beans. That is why at a AMT you'll hear the grinder go 'whirrr' for just 15-20 seconds for each shot of espresso. Finally, the last mile: the transformation of finely ground coffee into that perfect cuppa.
